To run a project:
1. Go to `server` folder and run `npm run start` to start server and connect with database
2. Run `npm run start` in the main directory to start a client

Steps 
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/pagum/WeTechTogether.git`
2. Create team's branch, for example: `git checkout -b profile-form-branch`
3. After adding changes push them to the repository to not lose them, add a commit message `git commit -m "add username input"`
4. After you finish your work open a pull request in github and assign speakers as a reviewers. They will review the pull request, discuss your solution and ad comments.

In case of any problems try to google the issue as a true developer and feel free to reach out to the speakers.
